# CSC 576: Data Mining

**Course Website:** [https://www.cs.wcupa.edu/rburns/DataMining/](https://www.cs.wcupa.edu/rburns/DataMining/)

### What is Data Mining?
* "The process of **automatically** discovering useful information in large data repositories"
* "To find novel and useful patterns that might otherwise remain unknown"

### What will we learn in this course?
* Learn basic-to-intermediate Data Mining Techniques
* Apply them to Datasets
* Program using Python
* Perform significant individual data mining project

### Process of converting raw data into useful information
1. Input data
    * MySQL
    * .csv
    * JSON
    * Twitter API
2. Data Preprocessing
    * Feature selection
    * Dimensionality Reduction
    * Normalization
3. Data Mining
    * Decision Trees
    * Support Vector Machines
    * Linear Regression
    * Nural Networks
4. Postprocessing
    * Visualization
    * Pattern interpretation
5. Reporting to Boss
    * "closing the loop"

### Types of Attributes
* **Nominal:**
    * *id, eye color, zip codes*
* **Ordinal:** order matters, but not the difference between values
    * *{small, medium, large}*
* **Interval:** Difference between two values is meaningful
    * Ex. tempature
* **Ratio:** clear definition of 0.0; none of a variable at 0.0
    * *counts, time*
* **Temporal:** Each record has a time associated wiht it
    * *retail transaction*
* **Spatial Data:** Each record has a position or area
    * *Geographical locations*

## Visualization

#### Histogram
* For showing the distribution of values
* Useful for **continuous** data

#### Box Plot
* Box plots show the distribution of the values for a single *numerical* value.
* Whiskers: top and bottom lines of the box plot

## Data Quality

#### Data Quality Report
